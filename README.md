#**(Currently learning ,might not work)**

RustAudioFX-rust is a versatile audio processing framework written in Rust. This project provides a robust platform for developing real-time audio applications, with support for various audio effects, low-latency processing, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Features

üîä **Real-Time Audio Processing**: Process audio signals in real-time with low latency, making it suitable for live performance, music production, and interactive applications.

üéõÔ∏è **Modular Design**: Design your audio processing pipeline using modular components for flexibility and scalability. Easily integrate custom effects, filters, and synthesizers into your application.

‚öôÔ∏è **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Build and deploy your audio applications across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, with support for desktop and embedded environments.

üöÄ **High Performance**: Leverage Rust's performance capabilities to achieve efficient audio processing without sacrificing safety or reliability. Take advantage of multi-core processors for parallel processing and optimal resource utilization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started with RustAudioFX-rust, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install): The Rust programming language and toolchain.
- [CPAL](https://crates.io/crates/cpal): Cross-platform audio library for Rust. Install using Cargo, the Rust package manager:

```bash
cargo install cpal
```

### Installation

To use RustAudioFX-rust in your Rust project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
rust_audio_fx = { git = "https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/RustAudioFX-Rust.git" }
```

### Usage

1. Import the RustAudioFX-rust library in your Rust project:

```rust
use rust_audio_fx::run_audio_processing;
```

2. Call the `run_audio_processing` function to start the audio processing pipeline:

```rust
fn main() {
    run_audio_processing();
}
```

3. Build and run your Rust project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```
